    <h1>Introduction to Web Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
      Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web.
      More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities
      can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that
      they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others,
      including older people with changing abilities due to aging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the
      Web, including
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>visual,</li>
      <li>auditory,</li>
      <li>physical,</li>
      <li>speech,</li>
      <li>cognitive, and</li>
      <li>neurological disabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Millions of people have disabilities that affect their use of the Web.
      Currently most Web sites and Web software have accessibility barriers that
      make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use
      the Web. As more accessible Web sites and software become available,
      people with disabilities are able to use and contribute to the Web more
      effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities. 
      For example,a key principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software
      that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and
      situations. This flexibility also benefits people without disabilities in
      certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection,
      people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with
      changing abilities due to aging.
